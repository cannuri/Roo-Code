This is a test file for upload functionality.
It contains multiple lines of text to verify that
file uploads work correctly in the browser tool.

The file upload feature should be able to:
1. Upload files to standard file inputs
2. Upload files to hidden file inputs
3. Handle different file types
4. Provide appropriate feedback

This test file is used in the e2e tests to verify
that the file upload functionality works as expected.
